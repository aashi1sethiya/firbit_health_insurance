## üìá **Problem Statement** 
- The traditional health insurance model faces significant challenges stemming from its lack of customization, resulting in inadequate coverage and increased costs for both insurers and policyholders
- Recognizing this issue, there is a growing need for a transformative approach to insurance that embraces personalization

## üè¢**Use Case**
- To meet this challenge, we are developing a platform that offers personalized health insurance plans tailored to individuals' specific health profiles
- By leveraging data obtained from Fitbit's personal monitoring device, we aim to gain deep insights into individuals' lifestyles, fitness levels, and health metrics
- Utilize this data to improve coverage, reduce costs, and promote proactive health management and well-being among policyholders

  ## üöÄ**Features**
- risk profiling
- dynamic premium calculation
- Fitbit continuous monitoring


## üìä **Data**
- **Data has been sourced from:**
  1. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit/data
  2. Some tables had Synthetic Data created with help of LLM
